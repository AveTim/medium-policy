# Medium Rules
There are places on the Internet without rules. This is not one.

Medium is designed for many people to share their opinions, thoughts, and ideas. Part of the beauty of such a system is that people are going to write stuff other people don't agree with. Sometimes this will be enlightening. Other times (perhaps, more often) it will be frustrating.

Because Medium is shared space, and we want many different ideas to thrive, we need to have a few ground rules. There aren't many. In fact, they can pretty much all be summed up thusly: Don't pee in the pool (metaphorically speaking). In other words...

## Things You Shouldn’t Do
#### Threats of Violence
Don’t threaten other users with violence.

#### Hateful Slurs
Recognizing the wide orbit that we ought to give to freedom of expression, our general view is that the best response to hateful speech is more speech, rather than censorship, but we reserve the right to take down hateful slurs.

#### Bullying and Harassment
You may not bully or harass people on Medium. We allow users to speak freely on matters and people of public interest, but we do not tolerate abusive behavior directed at private individuals.

#### Harm to Minors
Don’t post anything relating to minors that is inappropriately sexual or violent. Don't bully or harass minors.

#### Spam
Don’t spam. Don’t use deceptive tags or links or otherwise mislead other users about what you’ve posted. Don’t embed malicious code in your posts. Don't use deceptive means to generate revenue or traffic, or create posts with the primary purpose of affiliate marketing.

#### Mass Registration and Automation
Don’t register accounts or post content automatically, systematically, or programmatically.

#### Copyright and Trademark Infringement
Respect the copyrights and trademarks of others. Unless you are authorized to use someone else's copyrighted or trademarked work (either expressly or by legal exceptions and limitations like fair use), don't do it. It is our policy to respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement as per our Terms of Service and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

#### Deceptive Impersonation
Don’t impersonate someone else in a deceptive way. Parody and ridicule are fine, but make clear that that’s what you’re doing.

#### Porn
No porn. There are other places to post that. You know where those websites are.

#### Privacy Violations
Don’t use Medium to fish for personal information in deceptive ways. Don't post content that violates others’ privacy, including personally identifying or confidential information like credit card numbers, social security numbers, or non-public contact information.

#### Phishing and Other Frauds
Don’t use Medium to engage in phishing or fraud.

#### Promotion and Glorification of Self-Harm
Don't actively promote or glorify self-harm, by which we mean cutting, eating disorders like anorexia or bulimia, and suicide.

#### If You Break the Rules
If you violate these policies, you may receive a notice via email. If you don’t explain yourself or fix the problem, your account may be suspended and your IP address may be blocked. We do our best to act fairly, but we always reserve the right to suspend accounts or remove content, without notice, for any reason, but particularly to protect our services, infrastructure, users, or community. We reserve the right to enforce, or not enforce, these policies at our sole discretion, and these policies don't create a duty or contractual obligation for us to act in any particular manner.

We also reserve the right to change these rules using the procedures laid out in our [Terms of Service](https://medium.com/policy/medium-terms-of-service-9db0094a1e0f).

If you have questions or feedback, don't hesitate to [let us know](mailto:terms@medium.com).
